# Death system for long-lived beings

# Known elves lifespan
# 602, 381, 649 (Phoenix kings - so more longlived let's say 1.5)
## Bel Shanaar reigned for 1669 years
## & Bel Khorandis reigned for 1189 years
## This implies they were actually much older, as the phoenix king is an elected title
## Shadowblade was considered "very young" at 150 years old.
## I've seen speculation in several locations that the average lifespan is 2500
## we may want to address this accordingly -Erik
# let's say then that the average elves lifespan is ~1500 years
# 
# Nota by hermes: Malekith is still alive and lived more than 2000 years (he was the son of aenarion)
