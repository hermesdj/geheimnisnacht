# THE DOOM ENGINE
#
# Those events are responsible for maintaining the balance of forces in 
# WH world they compute the doom counter which 
# is the number used to describe how bad world is corrupted by chaos (1-100)
#
# Also those event are used to treat chaos invasions etc
#
# Armaggedon counter:
# 1-19  : the forces of order are at peak of their strength
# 20-39 : cultists activity minor beastmen attack
# 40-59 : severe cultists activity, disease, wars etc are spreading
# 60-79 : chaos invasion
# 80-99 : fate of world hangs in the balance, last time it was that bad in time of Anaerion the Defender
# 100 : ultimate destruction - game over
#
#
# Due the work of elven vortex which is sucking the chaos energies 
# the counter wents down each two months (-2)
#
# However every bad thing that happen in world increase a counter a little bit
