# Bretonnian quests will have a set of events that will guide them
# through their task. It will last a few years each time and grant
# them prestige, skill, traits and equipment and event a benediction
# from the lady of the lake !
# rulers will have a regent while on the quest
# TODO : complete the decisions & create the traits (virtues)
# Errant knights will have the knight virtue. This will give them decisions
# to prey for the lady (will give potential healing, martial bonus, health bonus, etc.
