*About Bretonnian Knights
I want to create two traits for the bretonnian knights: 
- bretonnian_knight : Knights of the Realm. Can obtain after successfully done the errant_knight_quest
- bretonnian_grail_knight : Grail knights. Obtained after successfull holy_grail_quest

**Knights virtues and grail virtues traits
- knight virtue: obtained when going on the errant_knight_quest. A character with this trait has access to a decision called "ask a blessing from the lady"
This decision will open an event where the knight can select a blessing (cure for example). The response of the lady will depend on the knight virtue, prestige and piety
- grail virtue: obtained when finishing the holy_grail_quest: this trait extends the choice of blessings one can ask to the lady

When becoming a knight of the realm, the character choose between a set of knight virtues that will be added to the knight virtue.
When becoming a knight of the grail, the character will gain the grail virtue associated to the knight virtue he chose.

**Errant knight quest
The quest will contain a list of events that can be fired annually. Those event chains will be like mini stories where the character will fight
against ennemies, obtain traits, equipment, prestige and gold. The character will have to choose from a list of choices to make for each event in the chain.

There will be a list of bad traits a knight cannot have unless he cannot begin the quest. If he gains the trait during the quest (ex. craven, slothful, cruel...) he will have an event
that will be fired to give him a chance to redeem himself but at great risks (death !)

When the character has a certain amount of prestige and completed a few quests, he will come back home and become a knight of the realm.

**Quest for the Holy Grail
The quest will be similar in mechanics and will share some events with the errant knight quest. However, most of the events will be much more
dangerous and with much higher rewards. Upon finishing each event chains, a counter will increase that will give a chance for the knight
to see the lady of the lake. He will then have an epic finishing event chain that will grant him a title and a LOT of prestige/piety

We do not want to see grail knights by the manies, so the quest will be dangerous and difficult.

**Forbidden traits for knights (having one of these will prevent from beginning any quest): 
- Craven
- Slothful
- Arbitrary
- Lustful
- Possessed
- Lunatic
- Weak
- Impaler
- Glutonous
- Greedy
- Envious
- Wroth (maybe not...)
- deceitful
- cynical
- cruel
- kinslayer
- blinded
- any chaos traits or mutation trait

Having some of these traits might trigger an event that will remove all knighthood to the character, even if he is a knight of the grail.
However, i am considering offering a "go on adventure" decision that can remove the bad trait in dangerous situations.
